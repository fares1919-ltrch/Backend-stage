# Optimistic Concurrency Control Pattern in RavenDB Implementation

One of the most sophisticated aspects of our backend is the implementation of optimistic concurrency control in the `RavenDbContext` class. This is a high-level pattern that demonstrates advanced database management techniques.

## What Makes This Advanced

The `ExecuteWithConcurrencyControlAsync` method in `RavenDbContext.cs` implements a robust pattern for handling concurrent database operations that's particularly impressive for several reasons:

```csharp
public async Task<T> ExecuteWithConcurrencyControlAsync<T>(
    DatabaseType databaseType,
    string documentId,
    Func<IAsyncDocumentSession, T, Task<T>> updateFunc,
    int maxRetries = 5)
{
    int retryCount = 0;

    while (true)
    {
        try
        {
            using var session = OpenAsyncSession(databaseType);
            var document = await session.LoadAsync<T>(documentId);

            if (document == null)
            {
                throw new InvalidOperationException($"Document with ID {documentId} not found in database {databaseType}");
            }

            document = await updateFunc(session, document);
            await session.SaveChangesAsync();

            return document;
        }
        catch (Raven.Client.Exceptions.ConcurrencyException ex)
        {
            retryCount++;

            if (retryCount >= maxRetries)
            {
                throw new InvalidOperationException(
                    $"Failed to update document {documentId} after {maxRetries} attempts due to concurrency conflicts", ex);
            }

            // Wait a bit before retrying with exponential backoff
            await Task.Delay(100 * (int)Math.Pow(2, retryCount));
        }
    }
}
```

## Why This Is Pro-Level

1. **Optimistic Concurrency Control**: The system uses RavenDB's optimistic concurrency feature (enabled with `UseOptimisticConcurrency = true` in the document store configuration). This is a sophisticated approach that allows multiple users to work with the same data simultaneously without locking, while still preventing conflicts.

2. **Exponential Backoff Retry Mechanism**: When a concurrency conflict occurs, the code doesn't just retry immediately. It implements an exponential backoff algorithm (`100 * (int)Math.Pow(2, retryCount)`), which means it waits progressively longer between retries. This is a professional-level approach to handling transient failures.

3. **Higher-Order Functions**: The method takes a `Func<IAsyncDocumentSession, T, Task<T>> updateFunc` parameter, which is a higher-order function. This allows the caller to pass in any document update logic while the concurrency handling is abstracted away. This is a sophisticated functional programming concept.

4. **Generic Implementation**: The method is generic (`<T>`), making it reusable across any document type in the system.

5. **Proper Resource Management**: The code uses `using` statements to ensure proper disposal of database sessions, which is crucial for resource management in a production system.

## Real-World Usage

The deduplication service demonstrates how this pattern is used in practice:

```csharp
// Update process status to Completed using concurrency control
try
{
  await _context.ExecuteWithConcurrencyControlAsync<DeduplicationProcess>(
    database ?? "processes", // Use the processes database
    process.Id, // Use the full document ID including the prefix
    async (noFilesSession, loadedProcess) =>
    {
      loadedProcess.Status = "Completed";
      loadedProcess.ProcessEndDate = DateTime.UtcNow;
      loadedProcess.CompletedAt = DateTime.UtcNow; // Ensure CompletedAt is set
      loadedProcess.CurrentStage = "Completed";
      loadedProcess.ProcessedFiles = 0;
      loadedProcess.CompletionNotes = "Done kamelna.";

      _logger.LogInformation("Process {ProcessId} status updated to Completed (no files)", loadedProcess.Id);
      return loadedProcess;
    },
    5 // Maximum number of retries
  );
```

## Why This Matters

This pattern solves a critical problem in distributed systems: how to handle concurrent updates to the same data. In a multi-user application, multiple users might try to update the same record simultaneously. Without proper concurrency control, this could lead to lost updates or data corruption.

The implementation here is particularly elegant because:

1. It's transparent to the caller - services using this pattern don't need to worry about the concurrency handling details
2. It's resilient - it automatically retries failed operations with intelligent backoff
3. It's type-safe - the generic implementation ensures compile-time type checking
4. It's consistent - it provides a standardized way to handle concurrency across the entire application

## Technical Depth

The pattern combines several advanced concepts:

1. **Document Database Transactions**: Understanding how RavenDB handles transactions and concurrency
2. **Functional Programming**: Using higher-order functions to abstract behavior
3. **Asynchronous Programming**: Properly managing async/await patterns with Task-based operations
4. **Error Handling**: Sophisticated exception handling with proper logging and retries
5. **Distributed Systems Concepts**: Understanding and handling race conditions in a distributed environment

This is the kind of pattern you'd see in high-scale, enterprise-level applications that need to handle concurrent operations reliably. It's a great example of professional-level software engineering that balances theoretical correctness with practical implementation.
