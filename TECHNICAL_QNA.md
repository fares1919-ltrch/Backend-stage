# Technical Q&A for Facial Recognition Deduplication System

This document provides answers to medium and hard technical questions about the Facial Recognition Deduplication System. It's designed to help technical team members understand the system architecture, implementation details, and troubleshooting approaches.

## System Architecture

### Q1: How is the database structure organized in this application?

**A:** The application uses RavenDB (NoSQL document database) with multiple separate databases to segregate different types of data:

- `users`: User accounts and authentication data
- `Files`: Uploaded file metadata and Base64 content
- `processes`: Deduplication process tracking
- `deduplicated`: Records of identified duplicates
- `exceptions`: Exception records for special cases
- `conflicts`: Conflict records for resolution

This separation provides better performance, security isolation, and simplified data management.

### Q2: How does the application handle database concurrency issues?

**A:** The application uses RavenDB's optimistic concurrency control with retry mechanisms:

1. The `RavenDbContext` sets `UseOptimisticConcurrency = true` in the document store configuration
2. Update operations are wrapped in retry logic that catches `ConcurrencyException`
3. When a concurrency conflict occurs, the operation retries with exponential backoff
4. After a configurable number of retries (default: 3), it throws an exception
5. This approach prevents data corruption while handling concurrent updates gracefully

### Q3: What is the role of the RavenDbContext in the application architecture?

**A:** The `RavenDbContext` serves as a centralized access point for database operations:

1. It manages the RavenDB document store configuration and initialization
2. Provides methods to open synchronous and asynchronous sessions for different databases
3. Handles certificate management for secure database connections
4. Implements retry logic for handling concurrency exceptions
5. Provides helper methods for common database operations
6. Abstracts database details from service classes, making them more testable

## Authentication & Security

### Q4: How does the system handle user roles and permissions?

**A:** The system implements a role-based access control system with three roles:

1. **User**: Basic access to upload files and view their own processes
2. **Admin**: Additional access to manage users and view all processes
3. **SuperAdmin**: Full system access including user promotion/demotion

The first user to register is automatically assigned the SuperAdmin role. Role-based authorization is enforced through attributes on controller actions and middleware checks.

### Q5: What security measures are implemented for API authentication?

**A:** The system implements multiple security measures:

1. JWT token-based authentication with configurable expiration
2. Cookie-based token storage with secure, HTTP-only settings
3. HTTPS enforcement for all production traffic
4. CORS policy configuration to restrict cross-origin requests
5. Role-based authorization for API endpoints
6. Password hashing using BCrypt
7. Google OAuth integration as an alternative authentication method
8. Refresh token mechanism to maintain sessions securely

### Q6: How does the system handle certificate management for secure connections?

**A:** The system manages certificates in several ways:

1. For RavenDB connections, it loads an X.509 client certificate from a configurable path
2. For T4FACE API connections, it configures an HttpClient with certificate validation
3. For HTTPS endpoints, it configures Kestrel to use HTTPS with default certificates
4. Certificate paths and passwords are stored in configuration (appsettings.json or environment variables)
5. The application includes certificate validation and error handling for secure connections

## Deduplication Process

### Q7: What is the complete workflow of the deduplication process?

**A:** The deduplication process follows these steps:

1. **Upload**: User uploads a tar.gz archive containing images
2. **Extraction**: System extracts images and validates formats (JPG, JPEG, PNG)
3. **Process Creation**: System creates a deduplication process with extracted files
4. **Face Registration**: Each image is processed with T4FACE API to register faces
5. **Face Identification**: Each face is compared against existing faces to find matches
6. **Duplicate Detection**: Matches above the similarity threshold create duplicate records
7. **Exception Handling**: Special cases create exception records
8. **User Review**: Users review potential duplicates and exceptions
9. **Confirmation/Rejection**: Users confirm or reject potential duplicates
10. **Optional Cleanup**: Process files can be cleaned up to free resources

### Q8: How does the system handle large files during the deduplication process?

**A:** The system employs several strategies for handling large files:

1. **File Size Validation**: Rejects uploads exceeding configured size limits
2. **Streaming Processing**: Processes tar.gz archives as streams to minimize memory usage
3. **Image Compression**: Compresses images before sending to T4FACE API
4. **Base64 Optimization**: Efficiently handles Base64 encoding/decoding
5. **Chunked Processing**: Processes files in batches to prevent memory exhaustion
6. **Asynchronous Operations**: Uses async/await pattern for non-blocking I/O operations
7. **Timeout Handling**: Implements timeouts for external API calls
8. **Error Recovery**: Can resume interrupted processes

### Q9: How does the system determine if two faces are potential duplicates?

**A:** The duplicate detection process works as follows:

1. Each face is registered with the T4FACE API, which returns a Face ID
2. The system then calls the T4FACE API's identification endpoint with each face
3. The API returns matches with similarity scores (0-100%)
4. Matches with similarity scores above the configured threshold (default: 70%) are considered potential duplicates
5. The system creates duplicate records for these matches
6. Special logic handles self-matches (same face registered multiple times)
7. The system also considers metadata like file names and creation dates

## T4FACE API Integration

### Q10: How does the system integrate with the T4FACE API?

**A:** The system integrates with the T4FACE API through the `T4FaceService` class:

1. **Face Registration**: Uses `/personface/addface` endpoint to register faces from images
2. **Face Identification**: Uses `/personface/identify_64` to identify faces against existing ones
3. **Face Verification**: Uses `/personface/verify_64` to directly compare two faces
4. **Face Detection**: Uses detection endpoints to validate images contain faces
5. The service handles authentication, request formatting, error handling, and response parsing
6. Implements retry logic for transient failures
7. Uses certificate-based authentication for secure API communication

### Q11: How does the system handle T4FACE API errors and failures?

**A:** The system implements robust error handling for T4FACE API interactions:

1. **Retry Mechanism**: Automatically retries failed API calls with exponential backoff
2. **Error Classification**: Categorizes errors as transient or permanent
3. **Circuit Breaking**: Prevents cascading failures during API outages
4. **Detailed Logging**: Records detailed error information for troubleshooting
5. **Exception Creation**: Creates exception records for API failures
6. **Process Status Updates**: Updates process status to reflect API failures
7. **Graceful Degradation**: Continues processing other files when one file fails
8. **User Notification**: Provides clear error messages in the UI

### Q12: What happens when the T4FACE API returns multiple matches with identical high confidence scores?

**A:** When the T4FACE API returns multiple matches with identical high confidence scores:

1. The system first checks if this is a self-match (same face registered multiple times)
2. It examines if all matches have the same person name and very high confidence (>90%)
3. If determined to be a self-match, it doesn't create a duplicate record
4. Otherwise, it creates a duplicate record with all matches
5. It sorts matches by confidence score (highest first)
6. It deduplicates matches to prevent redundant entries
7. The system stores all match details in the metadata for user review
